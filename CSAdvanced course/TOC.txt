Search for offensive words in the files

search - aho corasick
offensivewords - machine learning and bloom filter

Difference between trees and graphs


Tree data structure (inorder preorder postorser and bst and heap) and searched on them BFS and DFS- for binary tree


self balancing avl and red black trees


String matching fgrep - aho corasick

bloom filter will say it is there or not and search
example of hashing and searching


Compression technique
1. Machine learning FP and TP
2. call stack recursion 
3. and DP
4. DFS and BFS
5. Bloom fiter and aho corasick
6. compilers and parsers work example
7. mazes and games backtracking
8. debugging and unit testing
9. staple ai technique
10. use libraries and url shortner chat bot in python
11. RNG algorithms
12. multiplayer real time
13. fsm - for that algo and K maps map reduce
