#Diophantine equations are equations where only integral solutions are required

#linear diophantine equation - same way where there are integral values

#it has a property - gcd(a,b) is divisible by c
#ax+by =  c

#gcd(a,b) should be divisible by c

#Given two integers aa and bb:

#the Euclidean Algorithm computes GCD(a,b)
#the Extended Euclidean Algorithm gives out 2 integers xx and yy such that ax+by=GCD(a,b); mainly used when GCD(a,b)=1
#GCD is one they are coprime

#Use extended euclid's method for solving gcd

#Use it to check c % GCD(a,b) == 0
