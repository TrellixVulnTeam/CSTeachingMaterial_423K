<!-- 1. new concept "break" and "continue" to break from a loop 
     2. Alert and confirm "this site says" is a security measure and 
     can't be avoided
     3. guessword.indexof(guess) will return the index
     Go to developer tools and find out which one will help you and match
     4. And replace it with a loop and condition to loop through all
     the items in the array, and check if the guess word exists and 
     replace in that index
     5.Keep the debugger open
