Pseudo code
-----------
Pick	a	random	word
While	the	word	has	not	been	guessed	
{		
	Show	the	player	their	current	progress		
	Get	a	guess	from	the	player
	If	the	player	wants	to	quit	the	game	
	{				
		Quit	the	game		
	}		
	Else	If	the	guess	is	not	a	single	letter	
	{				
		Tell	the	player	to	pick	a	single	letter		
	}		
	Else	
	{				
		If	the	guess	is	in	the	word	
		{						
			Update	the	player's	progress	with	the	guess				
		}		
	}
}
Congratulate	the	player	on	guessing	the	word
